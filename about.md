[Dokter Waldijk](https://github.com/dokterw) works in IT with [EDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange). He is also a washed up, disgruntled [gonzo journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism) filled with fear and loathing after a few-year-stint in the field.

The Dokter has a degree Bachelor of Journalism, specialised in History and [International Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations).

Privacy and cryptography has been a huge interest and passion for the Dokter for a while. Even before he got his first computer running [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS).

For the moment the only ~~programming~~ scripting language he knows is [bash scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).

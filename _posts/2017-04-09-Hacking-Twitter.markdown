As some has noticed, I have taken a break from Twitter. Recently tho I decided to play with [Workflow](https://workflow.is). Creating a very simple workflow to post one of my favourite film quotes: *All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy*.

Twitter is however not a fan of duplicate updates.

Challange accepted!

To get around that, on a new line, I add a random number (1000-9999) that is hashed with MD5.

I also discovered a very nerdy way to post more than 140 characters. By using the built-in QR code generator in Workflow.

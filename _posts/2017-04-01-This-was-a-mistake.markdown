Writing, sharing my views, has always been a passion of mine. So has also, obviously, journalism. That is why I toyed with the idea of writing again. It was an itch I needed to scratch.

I don't have time nor energy for it. Actually, I really don't have time for anything other than sleep and work.

I wrote a long piece about why, but I rather stick with the shorter version.

Good night,
and good luck.
